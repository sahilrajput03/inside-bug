				Modify the multi line ability to navigate to respective up and down

				has been added(check the browser logs for that).{' '}
			</li>
			<li>
				Inject the some code inside the eval function so you can fetch the
				binding value from the input code from the user then.!!!

				Say, watch the code execution method in the image @ `tai-tae-dev` group
				of discord server for implementation deatails.
